<b>Local Innovation, Local Diffusion? A Reassessment of Knowledge Spillovers using Machine Learning</b>

<p>This paper introduces new measures of knowledge spillovers using machine learning/Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The existing literature predominantly uses citations data and finds that knowledge spillovers are highly localized. That is, after controlling for technology, a patent's forward citations are highly likely to originate from the same location as the patent.  I convert patent text to data using NLP and use cross-patent similarities as proxies for knowledge spillovers and to construct technology controls. I find evidence that strategic citations may overstate the localization effect under citations, as highly similar patents from different locations are much less likely to be cited. Under citations, local knowledge spillovers are between approximately 70%-120% higher than non-local spillovers.
Using similarity, I find much smaller and sometimes insignificant estimates: the similarity of local patents are approximately 0-10% higher than non-local patents after controlling for technology fields. These findings suggest that using citations may overstate the effect of localization.</p>
