<b>Measuring the Diffusion of Innovation: A Reassessment of Knowledge Spillovers using Machine Learning</b> (<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/Draft3.pdf">Preliminary Draft</a>)

<p>This paper introduces new measures of knowledge spillovers using machine learning/Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The existing literature predominantly uses citations data and finds that knowledge spillovers are highly localized. That is, after controlling for technology, a patent's forward citations are highly likely to originate from the same location as the patent.  I convert patent text to data using NLP and use cross-patent similarities as proxies for knowledge spillovers and to construct technology controls. I find evidence that strategic citations may overstate the localization effect under citations, as highly similar patents from different locations are much less likely to be cited. Under citations, local knowledge spillovers are between approximately 70%-120% higher than non-local spillovers.
Using similarity, I find much smaller and sometimes insignificant estimates: the similarity of local patents are approximately 0-10% higher than non-local patents after controlling for technology fields. These findings suggest that using citations may overstate the effect of localization.</p>

<h3> Works in Progress </h3>

<p><i>Effect of management and workplace policies on workers' job satisfaction.</i></p>
<p>Job review sites such as Glassdoor and Indeed have become increasingly utilized by both job seekers and current employees to better understand workplace culture and conditions. I collect over 1.2 million job reviews from Indeed.com, matched to firm level data was procured from Compustat. Natural language processing methods are used to identify terms that were significant in determining employee satisfaction, with a focus on terms that reflect job characteristics (such as pay, break, hours, management) and terms that reflect firm culture (inclusion, diversity, support, team). I find that reviews reflecting low job satisfaction frequently mentioned management negatively, as well as poor working environments (such as lack of support from peers and/or management). High job satisfaction reviews mentioned good benefits, opportunities to learn and advance, and high overall level of support within team environments.</p>

<p><i>State sponsored innovation: Examining government funded technology from past to present.</i></p>

<p>What kind of innovation is US government interested in sponsoring? Almost 50,000 U.S. patents disclose government interest or are assigned to government departments. I explore how the balance in government sponsored patents has changed in distribution across (i) different departments, such as NIH vs Defense Department; (ii) different technological fields; (iii) types of institutions, such as universities vs private sector firms. Specifically, I examine effects of the recent shift in focus away from global security towards domestic security and how recent technological developments have responded.</p>

<p><i> Maintaining suspicion: Job creation through surveillance and incarceration.</i></p>

<p>In recent years, the number of individuals employed in domestic law enforcement has risen dramatically. As low skilled jobs and job security in the private sector plummet, the public sector has increasingly filled the gap, by providing law enforcement careers in various federal and local law enforcement agencies. I examine the time trends in the extensive and intensive margin of job creation in local law enforcement compared to other jobs, and particularly other jobs for low-skilled individuals. Furthermore, I investigate how such shifts affect: (i) local rates of incarceration; (ii) local election outcomes; (iii) local budget allocations (particularly the trade off between law enforcement and public education).  </p>

<p><i> Professionalisation as barrier to entry. (Joint with Karen Huang) </i> </p>

<p>Entry into high-wage, high-skilled professions require not only the acquisition of reasonable qualifications, but also the adherence to a set of tacit social norms. We posit that the social norms of professionalism favour the ease of entry and attenuation of individuals who fit in (i) demographically; (ii) culturally and ideologically; (ii) behaviourally, with the majority. While demographic differences may be overcome with demonstrations of ideological and behavioural affinity, individuals who fall outside of the norms in all categories may be subject to higher rates of exit from the profession. This further entrenches the majorityâ€™s dominant position and focuses the field on their interests and agenda.  </p>
