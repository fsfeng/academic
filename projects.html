<b>The Proximity of Ideas: An Analysis of Patent Text Using Machine Learning</b> (<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/current_draft.pdf">Working Paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fsfeng/IdeaProximity">Code</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/JobPres-v2.pdf">Presentation Slides</a>)

<p>This paper introduces a measure of proximity in ideas using unsupervised machine learning. I explore knowledge relationships in innovative ideas by deriving vector space representations of patent abstract text using Document Vectors (Doc2Vec), and using cosine similarity to measure their proximity in ideas space. I illustrate the potential uses of this method with an application to localization in knowledge spillovers. In the first case, I use the standard citations approach in measuring localization, but use text similarity to select a control case patent instead of USPC class. While this improves matching on unobserved technological differences, I find that local patents still receive about 0.9-1.4 times more local citations than the non-local control. This may partially be explained by the role of patent lawyers in determining the localization patterns of citations. As an alternative to citations, I calculate the localization in idea proximity using patent text similarity. I find less evidence of localization: within a technology field, patents within the same city are 0.02-0.06 times more similar to each other than patents from other cities. These findings indicate that localization effects may indeed be smaller than standard citations methods suggest. As ideas proximity provide a different lens into knowledge relationships, I also discuss some implications and potential limitations in the use of text similarity methods.</p>


<p><i>Job Satisfaction, Management Sentiment, and Financial Performance: Text Analysis with Job Reviews from Indeed.com </i> (<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/QOWDraft.pdf">Working Paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fsfeng/QualityOfWork">Code</a>) </p>
<p>Employee job reviews contain information on many firm characteristics unobservable from the outside. Job review sites such as Glassdoor and Indeed have become increasingly utilized by both job seekers and current employees to better understand workplace culture. I collect over 1.2 million job reviews from Indeed.com, matched to firm level data was procured from Compustat. I use machine learning and natural language processing methods to obtain qualitative data about firms across the dimensions of job satisfaction and management sentiment In the cross-section, I find that a 1% increase in ratings increases market value by approximately 0.68-0.73%, revenue by 0.62-1.01%. However, increases in management sentiment may have a non-monotonic effect on financial performance. These non-monotonic relationships are also present in first difference results, which show that there may be trade-offs involved between financial results and workplace culture.

<p><i>Strategic Citations in Patents Using Machine Learning </i> (<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/SCDraft.pdf">Working Paper</a>) </p>
<p>Patent citations are the most commonly used indicator of knowledge relationships across patents. However, citation may be prone to strategic behaviour: inventors and firms may over-cite to offset the likelihood of litigation, and under-cite to increase the scope of the patent. As an alternative to citations, I construct a measure of proximity in ideas expressed in patent text using unsupervised machine learning algorithm Doc2Vec. Based on the similarity across patent texts, I find evidence that (i) applicants may strategically omit citations to patents in different cities, as infringement discovery is less likely; (ii) applicants cite their own prior inventions less after they change firms. This implies that use of citations to measure knowledge flows are affected by strategic biases.
