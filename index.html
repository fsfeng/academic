<p>I am a quantitative researcher using data science, machine learning, and NLP (natural language processing). I combine ML tools with informed economic thinking to produce unique insights. I recently graduated with a <b>PhD in Economics from NYU Stern (2019)</b>. Here's my most recent <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/current_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

<h3> Projects </h3>

<h4>Job Satisfaction, Management Sentiment, and Financial Performance: Text Analysis with Job Reviews</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scraped 1.2 mil+ job ratings and review texts of publicly listed companies and merged with financial performance data from Compustat for 2014-2018
  </li>
<li> Trained numerous supervised ML algorithms to predict job sentiment with review text. Highest accuracy of 88% achieved with XGBoost and deep neural nets.
  </li>
  <li>
    On average, a 1% increase in job ratings increases a company's market value by approximately 0.7%, revenue by 0.6-1%.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Established novel evidence that sentiment towards a company management has a non-linear effect on financial performance
        </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h4>The Proximity of Ideas: An Analysis of Patent Text Using Machine Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li>Converted 1.4 mil+ patent texts into meaningful numerical data using ML/NLP algorithms Doc2Vec and topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
  </li>
  <li>Using my machine learning method, I find that patents from the same city are 0-0.06 times more similar than patents from different cities. This shows that urban agglomeration has a small effect on flow of innovative ideas
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Different to prior research: large role for urban agglomeration since patents from the same city are 1-2 times more likely to be cited than patents from different cities
        </li>

      </ul>

  </ul>

  <h4>Strategic Citations in Patents Using Machine Learning</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Designed data experiments to find novel evidence of strategic bias in patent citation patterns using NLP text similarity.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Citations to textually similar patents in different cities are much less likely than similar patents in the same city
        </li>
        <li>Inventors cite their own prior patents less after they change firms
          </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h4>Creative Projects</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Poetry Generator with Markov Chains: Scraped 5000+ English language poems to generate random poems using Markovify in Python.
    </li>
  </ul>
