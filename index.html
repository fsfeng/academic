<h3> Research Statement </h3>
<p> I am an applied economist interested in the social effects of innovation and technology. I explore both new and existing questions using novel methods in machine learning and natural language processing. My research re-examines the localization of knowledge spillovers with broader implications for agglomeration; looks at the trajectory of government funded technological innovation and its implications for surveillance and carcerality; studies the impact of management on workplace culture and job satisfaction using job reviews and ratings. </p>
