<h3> Research Statement </h3>
<p> I am an applied economist interested in the social effects of innovation and technology. I explore both new and existing questions using novel methods in machine learning and natural language processing. My research re-examines the localization of knowledge spillovers with broader implications for agglomeration; looks at the implications of state and government interest in artificial intelligence, surveillance, and carcerality; studies the impact of management and employment policies on job satisfcation and workers' welfare using job reviews and ratings. </p>
